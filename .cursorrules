# Project Coding Standards

This project follows established coding standards and best practices documented in `.cursor/rules/`.

## ðŸš€ Quick Reference

### Testing Standards

- Use `screen` object for all test queries
- Prefer `userEvent` over `fireEvent` for interactions
- Import `act` from `@testing-library/react`, not `react-dom/test-utils`
- Follow semantic query priority: role > label > text > testId
- Structure tests with descriptive names and clear organization
- Use 4 spaces for indentation consistently

### File Organization

- Place test files next to components they test
- Use `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` extensions
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

## ðŸ“‹ Detailed Rules

For comprehensive guidelines, see:

- `.cursor/rules/react-testing-library.md` - RTL best practices
- `.cursor/rules/test-structure.md` - Test organization
- `.cursor/rules/README.md` - Complete documentation

## ðŸ”§ Rule Application

Rules are automatically applied based on file patterns:

- Test files: React Testing Library and structure rules
- All files: General coding standards
